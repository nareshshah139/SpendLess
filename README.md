# SpendLess
A simple budgeting app for Android. Enables user to follow a monthly budget. The user enters a monthly budget the first time
they start the app which will be displayed on the main screen. For every transaction the user simply enters a 
dollar amount and the name of the item purchased. The app subtracts the amount of the transaction from the monthly budget
and displays the remaining budget for the user to see. All transactions are saved in a database for the user to review
their monthly spending history. By default the remaining budget will reset to the desired monthly budget at the start of a 
new month. The user has the option of turning off/on the auto reset, changing their monthly budget, and resetting their 
budget whenever they wish.
